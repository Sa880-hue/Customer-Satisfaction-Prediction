# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project analyzes customer support tickets to understand satisfaction drivers and predict satisfaction ratings using machine learning.

### Overview

The aim is to process, analyze, and model customer support data to uncover key insights, visualize performance, and build an effective prediction model. Two interactive Excel dashboards are also included: one for EDA and one for ML results.

### Features

- SQL-based EDA and data cleansing using Google Colab + DuckDB
- ML pipeline for satisfaction prediction using Random Forest
- Feature engineering and label encoding
- Two Excel dashboards with slicers, charts, and inter-sheet navigation
- Exported charts like confusion matrix and feature importance
- Model metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sa880-hue/Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction

2. Open notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for SQL and ML steps.

3. Download `eda_summary.xlsx` and dashboards for interactive analysis.
